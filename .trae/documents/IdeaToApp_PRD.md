## 3. Core Process

**Main User Flow:**
1. User registers and accesses the Project Dashboard
2. User navigates to Idea Input Page and describes their application concept
3. System processes natural language and suggests project configuration
4. AI agents are activated in sequence: Browser Use → Figma MCP → Trae SOLO → GitHub MCP
5. User monitors progress in Design Studio and Code Workspace
6. TestSprite automatically generates and runs tests, reports results in Testing Center
7. CoreSpeed monitors performance and provides optimization suggestions
8. DeckSpeed generates pitch deck available in Pitch Generator
9. User can iterate, deploy, or share the completed application
